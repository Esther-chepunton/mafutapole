      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        Dini ya Roho mafuta pole ya Africa (DRMPA) began around 1940, founded by Apostle Lucas Pkech in Keringet, West Pokot County. Lucas Pkech, a Catholic-ordained catechist and a trained blacksmith from Kabete College, had a divine calling that led him to create jingles at Keringet.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        In a supernatural way, Lucas received visions and inspirations from the Holy Spirit regarding the plight of his people. During moments of silent prayer and meditation at Psoch Pogh (now Tartar Falls), the Holy Spirit bestowed upon him five songs, some of which include:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>Koroki kor kainani, nyu sopoi Pich ompo koros ×3</li>
        <li>Kinam sopon, kinam chichi tuw, Kura gorokinte cheopa, Kinam chirerio, Kinam owesyo, “chomyogh, “mokosio, ‘perur</li>
      </ul>

      </div>


      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        Through the Holy Spirit, Lucas received a message that would stop hate, malice, and disunity in the community, offering eternal life. This divine instruction led to the naming of the church as DINI YA ROHO MAFUTA POLE YA AFRICA, and Lucas received the baptismal name ARASUSU. New names continue to be given to all church members through the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        Lucas's devotion to God and his commitment to spreading the word led him to establish new congregations (Bomas), as inspired through songs like:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>1st karam kesagh ×3 cheopa</li>
        <li>2nd kisopin ngwno sayon ×2 toror sayon ×2 kisopin ngwno sayon</li>
        <li>3rd kelumchino kirwokintenyo</li>
        <li>4th wow papo cheopa ×2 kisominyi papo sopon nyowow nyo mito eu nyo wow</li>
        <li>5th cheopa nakuomba ×2 nipe nguvu nipate tushindi adui yetu</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        Despite facing challenges from the colonial government, Lucas continued his missionary work, attracting crowds with his songs. He became a target of the British government, which led to multiple arrests but did not deter his mission.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        After Lucas's eventual death, Rosti Akuny Achulo took over leadership and worked to maintain Lucas’s vision, even amid turmoil. Rosti’s eventual release and the changing political landscape paved the way for the church's enduring legacy, solidifying the foundation that Lucas had established.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        Today, the DRMPA continues to thrive, keeping alive the spirit of its founders through worship, community, and unwavering faith.
